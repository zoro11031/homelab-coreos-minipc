  # Note: The following compose services are installed but NOT auto-enabled.
  # They must be manually enabled during setup using:
  #
  # For Podman:
  # sudo systemctl enable --now podman-compose-media.service
  # sudo systemctl enable --now podman-compose-web.service
  # sudo systemctl enable --now podman-compose-cloud.service
  #
  # For Docker:
  # sudo systemctl enable --now docker-compose-media.service
  # sudo systemctl enable --now docker-compose-web.service
  # sudo systemctl enable --now docker-compose-cloud.service
  #
  # These services run as dockeruser and manage the compose stacks in /home/dockeruser/compose/
  # Choose either Podman or Docker services based on your container runtime preference.
